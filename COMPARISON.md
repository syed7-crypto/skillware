# Comparison: Skillware vs. Alternatives

Skillware is a Python framework that decouples AI tool logic, cognition, and governance into self-contained, installable modules called **Skills**. For the project story and roadmap, see [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md).

This document clarifies how Skillware compares to other common approaches for equipping AI agents with tools, including **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, **Agent Skills (SKILL.md)**, **LangChain Tools**, **AutoGen**, and others.

**A note on ecosystem convergence**: [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) and MCP address adjacent problems—host-level agent guidance and tool transport, respectively. Skillware remains a runtime capability framework built on a typed `manifest.yaml` → `execute()` contract; there is no plan to replace the Skill Package Standard with the SKILL.md format.

## Wallet screening: same task, different approaches

**Screening an Ethereum wallet for sanctions and risk** — qualitative comparison across four methods:

| Method | Speed | Cost | Accuracy | Reliability | Security | Setup |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skillware** (`wallet_screening`) | Seconds | Low (~$0 + optional Etherscan key) | High (deterministic OFAC/TRM-style data) | Repeatable, tested Python | Fixed code path | `pip install skillware` |
| **Prompt + web search** | Minutes | High tokens | Low (misses on-chain signals) | Varies per run | Generated code and scraping | Prompt engineering |
| **MCP / multi-agent** | Minutes+ | Tokens + infra | Medium (tool-dependent) | Server/agent-dependent | Many moving parts | Deploy servers |
| **Native APIs** (Chainalysis, TRM) | Sseconds | High (enterprise) | High | SLA-backed | Vendor-controlled | Contracts |

Skill detail: [wallet_screening.md](docs/skills/wallet_screening.md). Multi-layer screening runs locally in one call via [`finance/wallet_screening`](skills/finance/wallet_screening/).

## 1. Skillware vs. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) is an open standard that connects AI models to data sources and tools via a client-server architecture.

### Key Differences
*   **Architecture**: MCP operates on a **Client-Server** model (using JSON-RPC over stdio or SSE). While local stdio servers are an option, running and managing separate server processes is the norm. Skillware is **Python-Native**: it operates entirely within the Python runtime via library imports (`SkillLoader`) with no network overhead.
*   **Deployment Complexity**: MCP is powerful for language-agnostic, distributed systems and can run locally via stdio; Skillware is designed for direct in-process embedding into GenAI application pipelines. The two are complementary layers—MCP as a tool-transport protocol, Skillware as an in-process capability framework—not an either/or choice.

## 2. Skillware vs. Agent Skills (SKILL.md)

The [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard (originally from [Anthropic](https://github.com/anthropics/skills), now a multi-host open format supported by Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others) packages host-level agent guidance as `SKILL.md` files with optional `scripts/` including Python, loaded progressively by the host.

### Key Differences
*   **Model Agnosticism**: Agent Skills are host-dependent—execution is orchestrated by whichever client loads the SKILL.md (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). Skillware features **Universal Adapters**: you write a single `manifest.yaml`, and `SkillLoader` translates it dynamically at runtime to fit Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI formats natively.
*   **The "Managed" Runtime**: Both formats can bundle Python in a folder. The key difference is that Skillware enforces a **typed tool schema and a deterministic `skill.execute()` contract** via `SkillLoader`, rather than relying on host-orchestrated script runs alone. Skillware provides `base_skill.py` and `loader.py` for lifecycle, dependency checking, execution, and error handling automatically.

Skillware is not adopting Agent Skills (SKILL.md) as its registry format.

## 3. Skillware vs. Antigravity ("Agentic" Skills)

Frameworks like Google DeepMind's **Antigravity** use `SKILL.md` files to provide context to an autonomous coding agent working inside an IDE. This is distinct from the open Agent Skills (SKILL.md) standard in §2: Antigravity targets IDE procedural memory, not host-agent skill packs.

### Key Differences
*   **Target Audience**:
    *   **Antigravity Skills** provide **Procedural Memory** ("How to run this repository's build script") for a **Developer Agent** writing code.
    *   **Skillware** provides **Functional Capabilities** (executable Python logic like "Check this crypto wallet") for the **Runtime Agent** (the end-user application).

## 4. Skillware vs. LangChain Tools

[LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/tools/) provide interfaces that chains and agents use to interact with external APIs and systems.

### Key Differences
*   **Beyond Execution Wrappers**: LangChain tools frequently act as simple execution wrappers around an API. Skillware focuses on **uncoupled runtime logic, cognition maps, and system governance**. A Skillware module doesn't just contain the code to execute a task; it includes standard instructions on *how* the agent should reason about the tool (`instructions.md`) and strict safety guardrails (`manifest.yaml`).
*   **Code-First, Framework-Agnostic**: LangChain tools are tightly coupled to the LangChain ecosystem. Skillware's code-first structure and universal adapters let you seamlessly inject skills into *any* minimal pipeline orchestrating Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI. You do not have to adopt an entire heavyweight orchestration ecosystem to use a Skillware module.

## 5. Skillware vs. AutoGen

[Microsoft AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) is a framework for developing applications using multiple conversing agents.

### Key Differences
*   **Installable Capabilities vs. Internal Management**: In AutoGen, tool and skill management is typically handled internally by registering custom Python functions to specific agents. Skillware treats skills as **installable capabilities**—like `apt-get` for agents. Rather than coding functions from scratch, a developer can download a pre-vetted, domain-specific Skillware module and equip an AutoGen agent instantly.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: AutoGen focuses on multi-agent *orchestration* and conversation patterns. Skillware focuses purely on standardizing *domain expertise*. In fact, Skillware can be used *inside* AutoGen to provide its agents with standalone, secure, and pre-compiled capabilities.

## 6. Skillware vs. Microsoft Semantic Kernel (Plugins)

[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/) is an enterprise SDK that integrates LLMs with code using a system of "Plugins," which is philosophically similar to Skillware.

### Key Differences
*   **Lightweight vs. Heavyweight**: Semantic Kernel is a complete, heavy enterprise orchestration layer that requires adopting its entire C#/Python architectural paradigm and pipeline management. Skillware is intentionally minimal. It simply provides the capability bundle, enabling you to use it in lightweight 10-line Python scripts or custom agent loops without needing an enterprise orchestrator.

## 7. Skillware vs. CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) is a popular framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous agents to accomplish tasks.

### Key Differences
*   **The Orchestrator vs. The Supply Chain**: Developers often confuse agent orchestration frameworks with capability frameworks. CrewAI excels at defining *roles* and managing *handoffs* between agents, but the tools those agents use are often simple script-bound Python functions. Skillware does not compete with CrewAI; rather, it acts as the supply chain. You use CrewAI to orchestrate your multi-agent workflow, and you use Skillware to supply those agents with robust, vetted, and cleanly separated capabilities.

## The Token Economy Advantage

A critical architectural distinction is how Skillware treats logic execution versus "code generation."

*   **The Code-Generation Approach**: Many platforms prompt the LLM to write code on the fly to solve a requested problem. This is expensive (you pay for output tokens every time), slow, and risky (the LLM executes unreviewed code).
*   **The Skillware Approach**: Skillware relies on **Pre-Compiled Logic**. The logical system decides *which* tool to call (e.g., wallet_screening) and passes arguments. The heavy lifting happens deterministically in the Python `BaseSkill` implementation. This results in **zero-cost logic execution**, instant processing, and static, auditable code boundaries. In contrast, hosts using Agent Skills load full SKILL.md instruction context into the model at runtime and may rely on the host to generate or run code; Skillware keeps reasoning in `instructions.md` but executes work in pre-reviewed `skill.execute()`.
