## Installing Skills

Registry skills live under `skills/<category>/<skill_name>/` in the repository and in the PyPI package. After `pip install skillware`, load by ID from your project (`./skills/...`), via `SKILLWARE_SKILL_PATH`, or from the bundled registry copy under `site-packages/skills/`. See [Usage guides](../usage/README.md#finding-skills-on-disk).

```python
from skillware.core.loader import SkillLoader

# Load by registry ID (category/skill_name)
skill = SkillLoader.load_skill("finance/wallet_screening")
```
